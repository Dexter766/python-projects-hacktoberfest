#Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a single-player game in which the player has to clear a square grid containing mines and numbers. The player has to prevent himself from landing on a mine with the help of numbers in the neighbouring tiles.

##Intro
The 'M' symbol denotes the presence of a ‘mine’ in that cell. As we can see clearly, any number on the grid denotes the number of mines present in the neighbouring ‘eight’ cells.

The row and column numbers displayed along with the grid are helpful for our input system. As we know, keeping track of mines without any indicator can be difficult. Therefore, Minesweeper has a provision of using ‘flag’ to mark the cells, which we know contains a mine.

##Instructions:
1. Enter row and column number to select a cell, Example "2 3"
2. In order to flag a mine, enter F after row and column numbers, Example "2 3 F"
